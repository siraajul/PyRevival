# whenever we want to use mathematical operation we need to use arithmetic operator
print(12 + 13)

a = 12
b = 23
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)  # single always give floating point number as an answer if it is integer
print(a // b)  # flore division it will give answer non-floating
print(a ** b)  # double astric on the left side it is number and on the right side it is its power like 12 power 23
print(a % b)  # MOD - modules function
